# Network Scan and Analysis Report

## Overview

This repository contains the results of a network scanning task performed using Nmap and Wireshark on a local network (192.168.1.0/24). The purpose was to discover open ports, identify services running on devices, and analyze network traffic for security assessment.

## Files Included

- `scan_results.txt` - Nmap TCP SYN scan output showing discovered hosts and open ports.
- `capture.pcap` - Wireshark packet capture file during the Nmap scanning activity.
- `report.md` (optional) - Summary report with findings and security recommendations.

## Key Findings

- Several devices on the network were found with open ports for services like DNS (53), HTTP/HTTPS (80/443), and Windows SMB/NetBIOS (135, 139, 445).
- SMB-related ports pose common vulnerabilities and should be secured through patching and configuration.
- Router interfaces exposed on HTTP/HTTPS ports should be secured with strong passwords and regular firmware updates.
- Wireshark captures show TCP SYN and SYN-ACK packets representing the network handshake used to identify open ports.

## Usage

- Open `scan_results.txt` to view port scanning details.
- Load `capture.pcap` in Wireshark to visualize network traffic.
- Use the report for understanding network exposure and potential risks.

## Recommendations

- Regular patching and security hardening of network devices.
- Disabling unnecessary services and ports.
- Securing router and shared resources with strong authentication.
- Network monitoring for unusual or malicious traffic.
